# Changes

* Removed the background shadow when the picker is shown
* Replaced most shades of gray with iOS system colors

# Alderis
Alderis is a replacement for libcolorpicker, and a reusable color picker component (even usable in App Store apps - no private API use!). You can install it in place of libcolorpicker as a user, or swap over your package dependencies if you’re a developer.

Alderis is named for the Alderamin (Alpha) star in the Cepheus (Cephei) constellation. It doesn’t depend on [Cephei](https://hbang.github.io/libcephei/), but I consider it a friend of Cephei.

Developer documentation on Alderis’s new APIs, as well as a podspec + shared scheme for use with CocoaPods and Carthage, to follow. Just want to release what I have now because it’s functional and works just as well as a drop-in replacement for libcolorpicker’s API.
